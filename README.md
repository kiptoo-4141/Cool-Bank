# 🌱 Spring Boot Banking API

A modular microservices-based banking system built with Spring Boot. This project includes multiple services to simulate core banking operations, such as user management, account handling, transactions, and reporting.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project is composed of the following microservices:

| Service              | Description                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `user-service`       | Handles user registration, login, and profiles |
| `account-service`    | Manages customer bank accounts               |
| `transaction-service`| Performs deposits, withdrawals, and transfers |
| `report-service`     | Generates summaries and transaction reports  |
| `config-server`      | Centralized configuration management         |
| `service-registry`   | Eureka server for service discovery          |

All services communicate via REST and are registered with the Eureka service registry.

## 🔌 Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- PostgreSQL (ensure it's running and accessible)
- Maven
- Git

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-banking-api.git
cd spring-boot-banking-api
````

---

### 3. Database Configuration

Each microservice connects to a PostgreSQL database. Configure credentials in `application.yml` or via the `config-server`.

Example:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/userdb
    username: postgres
    password: yourpassword
```

---

### 4. Start Services in Order

```bash
# Start the Eureka service registry
cd service-registry
mvn spring-boot:run

# Start the config server
cd ../config-server
mvn spring-boot:run

# Then start each of the microservices
cd ../user-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../account-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../transaction-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../report-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```
